# Linear Regression

This repository is a comprehensive introduction to linear regression, designed to help users understand one of the foundational algorithms in machine learning through practical examples and real-world applications.

## Projects Overview

This repository contains 5 different linear regression projects:

#### 1. Best Selling Video Games
- **Data**: Dataset CSV file in `/Data/best-selling video games of all time.csv`
- **Notebook**: `Best Selling Video Games/Best Selling Video Game Prediction.ipynb`
- **Content**: Linear Regression Model for Game Data with example Predictions.
- **Objective**: This project demonstrates the practical application of linear regression machine learning techniques to analyze and predict video game sales using real-world data from the best-selling video games of all time.
- **Status**: Ready for analysis

#### 2. Energy Consumption
- **Data**: Energy consumption train and test dataset in `Energy Consumption/Data`
- **Notebook**: `Energy Consumption/Energy Consumption.ipynb`
- **Content**: Energy usage patterns and consumption data
- **Objective**: Predict energy consumption based on various factors
- **Status**: Ready for analysis

#### 3. Formula 1
- **Data**: Multiple datasets in CSV format located `Formula 1/Data`
- **Notebook**: `Formula 1/Formula 1 Analysis.ipynb`
- **Content**: Formula 1 race results and performance metrics
- **Objective**: This analysis explores the critical relationship between qualifying performance, pit stop strategy, and final race outcomes using historical data from 1995 to the present.
- **Status**: Ready for analysis

#### 4. Pokémon
- **Data**: Pokémon characteristics in `Pokémon/Data/Pokemon.csv`
- **Notebook**: `Pokémon/Pokémon Identification.ipynb`
- **Content**: Pokémon stats and characteristics
- **Objective**: Predict Pokémon stats based on other attributes
- **Status**: Ready for analysis

#### 5. Retail Sales Trends
- **Data**: Sales data in `Retail Sales Trends/Data/Warehouse_and_Retail_Sales.csv`
- **Notebook**: `Retail Sales Trends/Retail Sales Trends.ipynb`
- **Content**: This dataset contains large-scale operational data from a retail and warehouse sales system. It includes **sales volume**, **transfers**, and **supplier-product information**.
- **Objective**: The **goal** is to predict the value of `RETAIL SALES` using machine learning and deep learning models.
- **Status**: Ready for analysis

## Tips for Success

1. **Data Exploration**: Understand your data through visualization
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features from raw data
3. **Assumptions Check**: Validate linear regression assumptions
4. **Regularization**: Use when dealing with overfitting
5. **Cross-Validation**: Evaluate model performance properly
6. **Interpretation**: Focus on understanding coefficient meanings
